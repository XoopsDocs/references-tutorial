# The User Side

When we switch to the user side, we see the References that we've created in the Admin area, and they are also visible for the users:

## Index page

The index page \(index.php\) of the module displays the list of references \(online\) by category. The page also contains, if enabled, a link to the RSS feed. Note: The page title is taken from the title of the latest reference. Similarly, meta keywords are generated from the description of the latter reference.

## Page categories

This page contains the same content as the index page but limited to a certain category \(considering permissions\)

## A reference page

Use this page to see the full content of a reference \(taking into account the permissions\)

## RSS feed

This page \(rss.php\) appears, if the option is enabled, an RSS feed that lists the latest references of module.
